# BalatrOverlay

## Overlay mod for game "Balatro" writen on lua

### What this mod allows (and will allow)

    1. See the combinations in the hand. (WIP)
    2. Calculate the odds of each combination falling out when the hand is discarded (WIP)
    3. Calculating the chips the hand will bring (WIP)

## Why did I do this

I think balatro is a very tough game. Especially if you want to conquer it, because you need to be oriented to the situation and make calculations in your mind as chips and possible combinations at discard

Therefore, I decided to write this mod, which will help people who do not want to go into the depths of probability theory to enjoy the game without losing Full House in a search for a Flush

## Installation

To install this mod simply use a [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) modloader and put the .lua file in Mods directory
