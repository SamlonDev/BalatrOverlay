# BalatrOverlay

## Overlay mod for game "Balatro" written on lua

### What this mod allows (and will allow)

    See the combinations in the hand. (remained Flush House)

## Why did I do this

I found the original mod very handy, but I had a different idea in mind
my version of the mod removes all visual bloat, and leaves only the in-hand combinations
also, I removed code that was writing to the game state as this made this mod quite unstable at times

## Installation

To install this mod simply use a [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) modloader and put the .lua file in Mods directory
